1) space contacts to mux further out (add padding) so that metal 1 doesn't get too close to the vertical columns
2) fix disqualification of contacts on grid used to access off-grid points
3) separate left/right side net names for contact?
4) fix order of search?

write hdl21 to simulate mux
- should be scaffold, the generator should output the netlist itself and that should become the DUT

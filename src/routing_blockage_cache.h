class RoutingGrid;

// This class provides a way to inspect the impact of blockages on a read-only
// RoutingGrid. It's goals are:
//  - to be usable in a multithreaded path-search;
//  - to provide fast blockage resolution;
//  - to provide fast blockage lookups; and
//  - to provide fast resolution of small blockage differences between
//  instances.
//
// The general approach is to memoise as much of the blockage resolution as
// possible, and then track the source of the blockages so that they can be
// removed piecemeal.
//
// The biggest benefit will be from caching hit-tests; mapping shapes to
// affected vertices and edges is costly, and it is often repeated. So for a
// given shape and padding we have to cache the affected vertices (including
// access directions) and edges. Vertices on the grid are efficiently searched
// because RoutingGridGeometry maps to their indices. Off-grid vertices are
// efficiently searched with a k-d tree.
//
// A typical use case for this class is that, when routing many nets, a single
// set of ports exists in the design and must be tested for blockage. However,
// in a given path search some subset of those ports are considered exceptions
// that should not cause blockages (these are usually the ports on the nets
// being routed). We store the blockages first, and the exceptions in child
// instances, which can be owned by each thread.
//
// The source of any blockage is a Shape, and the identity of that shape is its
// position in memory. All of the shapes referenced by these classes must be
// owned externally, typically by the caller of all RoutingGrid methods.
//
// The principal question this class shall answer is: is this thing blocked?
//
// Ok how bout this. Since RoutingGridBlockages store copies of the blocking
// shape (for reasons?), we have to do shape-equality checks to resolve which
// blockages are exceptions. This is kind of expensive. It's much cheaper to
// figure out which blockages are cancelled by matching the shapes up front,
// then store a list of cancelled blockages. But we also have to do this for the
// parent. We have to pass cancellations to the parent and figure out which
// blockages are affected. Which means the parent has to be set before
// CancelBlockages() is called and to make things simpler it is then immutable.
// It also means that the parent must outlive the child, since the child has
// pointers to the parent's data. It also means that child Caches operate in a
// significant different mode to parent Caches.

  // accessors and use a standard interface. As is this is kind of gross, sorry.

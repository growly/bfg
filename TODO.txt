Sorry, GitHub issues, I want to write a text note to myself:

0) FIXME(aryap): Make ViaFootprints a RoundedRectangle when adding KeepOut.

1)FIXME; ok to add these we need a smarter router that stops avoiding ports
 after they've been connected. Or maybe it only ever avoids one? An unblocked one?

1) add additional OIBS2 muxes :/

2) add option for top AND/OR BOTTOM dummy rows in Sky130InterconnectMux* generators
4) fix deadlock in router (different paths call same fn with different locks - ValidAgainstKnownBlockages or wahtever)
5) DecapFill would be a cool cell. We have some version of this in the
Sky130InterconnectMux1/2 already so it should be straightforward. Just fill a
MemoryBank with decap, fitting to a given height/width in height/width units...

7) fix LUT generator
a) bug with random met2 pour between two unrelated nets
b) are all routes added correctly? looks like another bug with routes


h) add carry logic
- carry logic seems difficult at the outset because, if implemented like in the
  UltraScale, we have to double the width of all muxes to accommodate the carry
  outputs as possible inputs. that means adding an extra flip flop per output
  mux, so 2 more.

per design:
  LUT needs feature which makes register/combinational output muxes 3:1 instead
  of 2:1, with +1 bit of extra memory each

i) need soft s44 selector ff and mux too, for between the luts

8) assign interconnect wire block break-out and break-in offsets correctly

9) generate connectivity netlist based on ultrascale architecture

10) route ReducedSlice

Sorry, GitHub issues, I want to write a text note to myself:

ReducedSlice problems:

1) There is a parity problem with different-sized muxes. Some have VPWR rails
top and bottom, others have VGND. Mixed, the VPWR and VGND rails overlap, and
nwells are too close, and disaster.
- An "easy" fix seems to be to move the horizontal routing channel to the other
  side, but this isn't ideal since now the channels are imbalanced.
- A harder fix is to add an option to flip _every_ row, meaning now the
  outer-most rails will be the opposite ones. This will be hard to route around
  with the strict schemes in place, but it might also be not that hard.

2) Setting
 horizontal_pitch_nm: 340
 vertical_pitch_nm: 340
 vertical_offset_nm: 170

on Sky130InterconnectMux2 avoids some met1 spacing errors in the met1 routing,
which I had not seen before. These would ideally not happen as a function of
these settings, which are just the PDK defaults.

Worse, the mcon vias stamped out between cells do not overlap correctly, and it
definitely has something to do with how the vertical pitch changes the vertical
routing channel width or something. Anyway, need to figure out what parameters
to keep to align everything.

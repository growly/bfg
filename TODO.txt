Sorry, GitHub issues, I want to write a text note to myself:

ReducedSlice problems:

1) There is a parity problem with different-sized muxes. Some have VPWR rails
top and bottom, others have VGND. Mixed, the VPWR and VGND rails overlap, and
nwells are too close, and disaster.
- An "easy" fix seems to be to move the horizontal routing channel to the other
  side, but this isn't ideal since now the channels are imbalanced.
- A harder fix is to add an option to flip _every_ row, meaning now the
  outer-most rails will be the opposite ones. This will be hard to route around
  with the strict schemes in place, but it might also be not that hard.

2) add option for top AND/OR BOTTOM dummy rows in Sky130InterconnectMux* generators
3) finish laying out 8x 4-LUT generator
4) fix deadlock in router (different paths call same fn with different locks - ValidAgainstKnownBlockages or wahtever)

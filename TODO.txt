Sorry, GitHub issues, I want to write a text note to myself:

1/28/26

1) add additional OIBS2 muxes :/

2) add option for top AND/OR BOTTOM dummy rows in Sky130InterconnectMux* generators
4) fix deadlock in router (different paths call same fn with different locks - ValidAgainstKnownBlockages or wahtever)
5) DecapFill would be a cool cell. We have some version of this in the
Sky130InterconnectMux1/2 already so it should be straightforward. Just fill a
MemoryBank with decap, fitting to a given height/width in height/width units...

7) fix LUT generator
a) bug with random met2 pour between two unrelated nets
b) are all routes added correctly? looks like another bug with routes
c) flip-flops on both sides not matching orientation, which would help for
tiling. maybe every other LUT is rotated?
d) carry-chain + output flop

8) assign interconnect wire block break-out and break-in offsets correctly

9) generate connectivity netlist based on ultrascale architecture

10) route ReducedSlice

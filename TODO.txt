Sorry, GitHub issues, I want to write a text note to myself:

1/28/26

1) add additional OIBS2 muxes :/

2) add option for top AND/OR BOTTOM dummy rows in Sky130InterconnectMux* generators
4) fix deadlock in router (different paths call same fn with different locks - ValidAgainstKnownBlockages or wahtever)
5) DecapFill would be a cool cell. We have some version of this in the
Sky130InterconnectMux1/2 already so it should be straightforward. Just fill a
MemoryBank with decap, fitting to a given height/width in height/width units...

7) fix LUT generator
a) bug with random met2 pour between two unrelated nets
b) are all routes added correctly? looks like another bug with routes
c) flip-flops on both sides not matching orientation, which would help for
tiling. maybe every other LUT is rotated?

d) add output flop, connected to application clock, with second LUT out
+1 bit memory

e) add new bypass input and a mux that outputs either the LUT output or the
bypass. actually, my ultrascale-like interconnect assumes only 2 outputs total,
so this should just be a mux in front of the existing combinational out (the
other output is the registered one)
+1 bit memory

f) add mux at one input of every 2nd LUT to select from output of first lut
(note that it should be an input used later in address resolution, ideally the
last one, s3, since that will mask the propagation delay through the first lut).
+1 bit memory

g) add output flop and a mux that selects between bypass and lut.

h) add carry logic
- carry logic seems difficult at the outset because, if implemented like in the
  UltraScale, we have to double the width of all muxes to accommodate the carry
  outputs as possible inputs. that means adding an extra flip flop per output
  mux, so 2 more.

8) assign interconnect wire block break-out and break-in offsets correctly

9) generate connectivity netlist based on ultrascale architecture

10) route ReducedSlice
